# JavaScript-Quiz

Description

My motivation for creating this project was to take JavaScript element manipulation to the next level in a fun and educational way.
I built this project because it takes certain JavaScript concepts to complete, i.e, timer functionality and page redirection.
This project gives the user a fun and interactive experience along with learning some bits of knowledge on JavaScript.
I learned how JavaScript can manipulate HTML and CSS elements in real time as a user progresses through an application.
